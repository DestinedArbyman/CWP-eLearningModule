This project is the packaged and published version of Communicating with Presence from Virtua Health, a collaborative work with Chris Corwin in improving the new-hire experience among Virtua Health faculty.  This project was published through Articulate Storyline 2 as an HTML5/SCORM package, and so needs to be downloaded completely and unchanged in order to view it.

To view the project, download the ZIP file, and unpack it as is into a folder of your choosing, leaving all of the files inside of the "projCommWithPres" folder to properly view everything.
